ðŸŒ³ Building Predictive Models ðŸŒ³
One of the most exciting tasks during my internship was building a decision tree classifier to predict customer purchase behavior using the Online Shoppers dataset from Kaggle.

By analyzing demographic and behavioral data, I gained hands-on experience in creating and optimizing machine learning models. This project emphasized the importance of feature selection and evaluation metrics in driving accurate predictions.
